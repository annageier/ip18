The Search Engine prototype is managed and built with Gradle. What
follows are instructions on how to use Gradle to build and run the
search engine, how to import the project to IntelliJ, and more.

Files and directories:

  src          Search Engine server
  static       Search Engine client
  data         Search Engine database files
  gradle       Gradle build tool (needed to e.g. compile)
  [build]      Gradle output (class files, documentation, ...)
  build.gradle Gradle configuration file
  gradlew      Gradle script (Linux/Mac)
  gradlew.bat  Gradle script (Windows)
  HOWTO.txt    This readme

List available Gradle tasks:

  ./gradlew tasks

Run Search Engine from command line. Here, data/enwiki-small.txt is a
supplied database file. In Windows, the path might be different (and
you might need to provide an absolute path).

  ./gradlew bootRun --args data/enwiki-small.txt

Run unit tests:

  ./gradlew test

Generate JavaDoc:

  ./gradlew javadoc

Delete everything generated by Gradle:

  ./gradlew clean

Generate IDEA IntelliJ project files:

  ./gradlew idea
